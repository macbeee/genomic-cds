Instructions to generate the cds ontology.

1. Update the list of cds rules and gather the corresponding genes.
2. Update the haplotype spreadsheet of PharmGKB content with the gathered genes.
3. Use the script 'gather_snp_in_haplotype_and_rules_files.php' to obtain the SNPs in the haplotypes definitions and in the rules files.
4. Use the collected list of SNPs to download the updated xml file with the description of SNPs from dbSNP source.
5. Indicate in the file "list_snps_not_in_dbSNP.txt" the SNP ids of the collected SNPs that were not found in dbSNP. If other SNPs must be avoided for generating the CDS ontology, indicate their rsid in the file.
6. Execute the script 'disable_overlapping_haplotypes.php' to detect overlapping definition in the haplotype tables. 
7. Use the resulting haplotype tables with the disabled rows to generate the genomic cds ontolgies with the last version of the script 'generate_genomic_CDS.php'.
8. Check the report file of the generation of the ontologies to find errors in the data. Fix the errors, document them into the change_log file and repeat steps 5-8 until no more errors are found.
9. Check the consistency of the ontologies.
