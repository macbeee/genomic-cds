  <h2><a id="detailed-information">Let’s make data on essential pharmacogenes available for every patient everywhere!</a></h2>
  <p>The availability of pharmacogenomic data of individual patients can  significantly improve physicians' prescribing behaviour and lead to a <strong>reduced incidence of adverse drug events</strong> and an<strong> improvement of effectiveness of treatment</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>major barriers</strong> to the wide-spread implementation of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice remain: </p>
  <ul class="contactsidebarList">
    <li> Significant  financial cost and turnaround time as well as limited availability of indication-specific pharmacogenomic tests.</li>
    <li>Difficulties in the storage, exchange, and interpretation of  pharmacogenetic data.  In particular, interoperable electronic  health record systems that are capable of storing structured genetic test  results and transmitting those results to other care providers are needed;  unfortunately, this type of infrastructure is not available in most parts of  the world. </li>
    <li>A lack of easily accessible computer-based clinical  decision support systems that can assist clinicians with the interpretation of pharmacogenetic  data – a vital component to the use of these data at the point of care.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>A possible solution: the Medicine  Safety Code</h2>
  <p> To make patient genotype data  on essential pharmacogenes globally available for routine medical care,  technologically-simple and intuitive systems are required in order to minimize  the need for specialized infrastructure, software, and knowledge. <span class="highlighted">The Medicine Safety Code initiative is an effort to improve the ability of clinicians and  patients to share pharmacogenetic data and to use it  at the point of  care.</span>  This system consists of two major  components: </p>
  <ul class="contactsidebarList">
    <li><strong>The  Medicine Safety Code (MSC), a standardized two-dimensional (2D) barcode</strong> that  captures data about genetic variants in essential pharmacogenes for an individual  patient. The 2D barcode is based on the Quick Response (QR) code standard, which has become widely popular in recent years because it can be decoded quickly and reliably, has relatively high  information density and can encode hyperlinks to pages on the World Wide Web. In addition, the MSC data can also be embedded in electronic health records.</li>
    <li><strong>A  curated knowledge base</strong> that contains information about essential  pharmacogenes, including haplotype definitions, phenotype translations and  clinical guidelines. This knowledge base is used to automatically interpret the  genetic data that is encoded within the 2D barcodes. The knowledge base  leverages semantic technologies and ontologies to ensure a high degree of  interoperability with other systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A proof-of-concept  prototype of the MSC system has been developed and   performed well in  preliminary tests. For the prototype, data on 385 pharmacogenetic markers were encoded  as a 2D barcode, which could quickly be decoded and interpreted using standard smartphone devices.</p>
  <h2>Benefits and applications of the  Medicine Safety Code</h2>
  <p>The MSC could act as an <strong>enabling technology</strong> for the widespread dissemination and clinical  implementation of pharmacogenetic data and decision support for several reasons:</p>
  <ul class="contactsidebarList">
    <li><strong>Immediately implementable.</strong>  The MSC  is based on technology that is low-cost and widely available, and  implementations would require minimal integration with existing clinical  infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>No specialized hardware or software is required  to use the codes.</strong>  The 2D barcodes used by the MSC can be  printed on personalized cards that patients can carry in their wallets, or they can be incorporated in paper-based lab reports. The images can also be saved electronically  and shared via e-mail.  The 2D barcodes  can be quickly decoded using common smartphone devices to yield  clinical decision support messages that are pertinent to  the individual's genetic profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Providing access to decision support, anywhere.</strong>  The MSC  enables patients and care providers to access pharmacogenomic data and relevant  clinical decision support algorithms in all health care settings, including  outpatient and emergency situations, regardless of whether the care facility  has implemented a genome-enabled electronic medical record and local clinical  decision support algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Patients can opt-in and opt-out at any time.</strong>  Patients  can choose whether or not to carry their anonymized pharmacogenomic data in  their pockets and make their data available to care providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent of the genotyping platform.  </strong>The MSC captures the result of genetic testing independently from the  platform that was used to produce the results.   Therefore, a wide variety of genotyping or sequencing platforms can be  used to generate standardized representations of the most important test  results on essential pharmacogenes.</li>
    <li><strong>Local implementations can be deployed.  </strong>The MSC system aims to be independent from local technological platforms,  since no specialized equipment is needed for creating, transporting and  interpreting the pharmacogenetic information. No investment in a dedicated  infrastructure is required to start using the system, but if a customized  implementation is desired, the MSC can be deployed locally.  The system specifications and source code  will be made openly available.</li>
    <li><strong>Lowering costs through data re-use.  </strong>The MSC provides a simple, effective means for sharing genetic test  results at the point of care.  Costs for  pharmacogenetic testing could be reduced by facilitating the re-use of genetic  test results and a reduction in redundant testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Barcodes are customizable.</strong>  Custom  2D barcodes can be created for specific gene panels, if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitating return of results.  </strong>The MSC could be used as a simple, low-cost method for returning genetic  test results to patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitating the development of tailored  therapeutics. </strong>Last but not least, a broad adoption of the MSC could also provide  benefits for drug development. When data on a minimal set of essential  pharmacogenes are made cheaply available for large patient populations,  these pharmacogenes could be used for patient stratification during clinical  trials (&lsquo;tailored therapeutics&rsquo;). This could help to bring new therapies to  market faster and with fewer losses caused by concerns about safety and efficacy,  which are often encountered in the development of non-tailored therapeutics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The MSC is intended to  complement local pharmacogenomics initiatives by providing a simple method for  making pharmacogenetic data more portable across geographic regions and health  care networks.</p>
  <h2>Join to make ubiquitous personalized medicine a reality!</h2>
  <p>The MSC is a  technologically-simple and intuitive system that could address many of the  barriers that limit the ability to share and utilize pharmacogenetic test  results in clinical practice, but the true potential of this project will not  be realized until the MSC is tested in different scenarios.  Partnerships with clinical institutions, researchers, pharmaceutical companies,  genetic testing providers, health IT companies and governmental organizations are needed.</p>
